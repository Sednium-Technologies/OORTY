# Oorty

**A powerful, native Android AI chat client designed for privacy, flexibility, and agentic workflows.**

Oorty is a fully native Jetpack Compose application that connects you to the world's leading foundational models, as well as your own local models. Whether you're running Ollama on your home server or connecting to Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4o, Oorty provides a unified, highly polished interface.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)**: Connect directly to providers like Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, xAI Grok, Groq, OpenRouter, and NVIDIA NIM.
- **Local & Offline AI**: Seamlessly connect to local model runners like **Ollama** or **LM Studio** via custom base URLs. Keep your data entirely private.
- **Multimodal Chat**: Attach images and text files directly to your prompts. The app automatically handles formatting for different provider APIs, including smart vision capability detection and warnings.
- **Native Voice Input with Live Preview**: Free, on-device voice dictation using Android's native `SpeechRecognizer`. Watch your words transcribe in real-time with live partial-text previews.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Connect to MCP servers to extend your AI's capabilities with external tools and data sources.
- **Real-time Agent Activity**: Watch the model execute tools and commands in real-time with the built-in Agent Activity overlay.
- **Prompt Lab & Rewrite Tones**: A dedicated workspace to test system instructions. Features a rich 'Rewrite' tool with customizable tones (Professional, Casual, Concise, Persuasive), Summarization, and Code Generation.
- **Performance Insights**: Track Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and approximate tokens-per-second decode speeds for every message directly in the chat bubble.
- **Configurable Presets**: Save your favorite combinations of models, system instructions, and chat modes (Quick, Thinking, Coding) for instant access.
- **Privacy First**: All your chat histories, API keys, and settings are stored locally on your Android device behind biometric authentication.
